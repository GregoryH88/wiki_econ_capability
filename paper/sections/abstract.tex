\begin{abstract}
We introduce a new method to jointly rank the quality of articles and the expertise of editors in Categories of Wikipedia, based on the bi-partite network of contributions between editors and articles.
We show that this so-called "reflexive" ranking method exhibits high correlations with usual article quality and user expertise metrics, which account for quality on Wikipedia (that we assume to be a grand truth here). 
In particular, we find that the quality of an article can be captured very well by our method right after a few edits, while the expertise of editors is captured increasingly better over time. 
Our results suggest that it is easier to predict the quality of an article from the 
editors who touched it, rather than editor expertise from articles they have 
edited.
