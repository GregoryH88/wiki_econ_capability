\section{Method}
\label{method}
Measuring the structure of value creation by individuals is nearly impossible in most in open collaboration projects, in particular when they do not involve writing software code, which can be compiled, executed and tested on computers. However, like in Wikipedia, the most common way to code knowledge is natural language, which cannot be executed and tested for performance. So often very rough, or worse misleading metrics are used, for instance on Wikipedia edit count is widely used \cite{editcountitis}. Bi-partite network models of editors and their contributions to articles provide a general framework  to understand the structure of value creation in open collaboration. 

We consider a matrix $M_{ea} \equiv M$ of all editors having contributed to a category of articles on Wikipedia: $M_{ea}$ takes value $1$ if editor $e$ has edited article $a$, and $0$ otherwise. Note that $M$ only shows which editors have {\it touched} which article, and importantly not their edit count for each article. For the category {\it Feminist Writers}, as presented on Figure \ref{fig:triangle}, $M$ exhibits a triangular structure where the most contributing editors having touched most of the articles and the less contributing editors having touched mainly heavily-touched articles. Similarly, a few articles are edited by a most editors, while the lesser touched articles are edited mainly by heavily-touching editors. $M$ is the only input of the {\it bi-partite random walker} model described thereafter, for characterizing the structure and the value of contributions in open collaboration.

\caption{Typical $\mathbf{M}$ matrix for a Wikipedia category (here, {\it Feminist Writers}) ordered on both dimensions by descending order of number of articles modified by an editor (horizontal axis) and of number editors who have modified an article (vertical axis). The structure of $\mathbf{M}$ is triangular and shows that some editors have a pervasive activity over articles, while most editors edit only a few. Similarly, some articles receive widespread attention by editors, while most articles are modified only by a few editors.}
\label{fig:triangle}
\end{figure*}


Given $M$, a simple way to assess the contribution value of an editor is obtained by summing the number of articles ever edited out of a set of articles. Similarly, a simple {\it quality} measure for an article is the sum of editors who have ever modified it, following the famous adage on open source development: ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" \cite{raymond1999}. These crude expertise and quality metrics for editors and articles respectively are given by,

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
 u_{e}^{(0)} = \sum_{a=1}^{N_{a}} M \equiv k_e\\[7pt]
 u_{a}^{(0)} = \sum_{e=1}^{N_{e}} M \equiv k_a
\end{cases}
\label{HHinit}
\end{equation}

are the zero\textsuperscript{th} order of our algorithm. They are  the initial step of the {\it method of reflections} proposed by Hidalgo et al. \cite{hidalgo2007,hidalgo2009}, which derives the value of producing entities (i.e. editors) from products (i.e. articles), and {\it vice versa}. To help capture the intuition behind the method of reflections for open collaboration we walk through the first iterations, as they are adapted to Wikipedia:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf 1\textsuperscript{st} order iteration}:  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Articles} If an article has been edited by higher expertise editors, it is higher quality. That is, quality is a function of expertise calculated from zero\textsuperscript{th} iteration expertise scores.
  \item {\bf Editors} Conversely, if an editor has contributed to higher quality articles, their expertise is higher. That is, expertise is a function of quality calculated from zero\textsuperscript{th} iteration quality scores.
  \end{itemize}
  \item {\bf 2\textsuperscript{nd} order iteration} : 
    \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Articles} If an article has been changed by higher expertise editors who have edited higher value articles, which in turn have been edited by higher expertise contributors, article quality is higher. That is, quality is a function of expertise calculated from 1\textsuperscript{st} iteration expertise scores.
  \item {\bf Editors} Conversely, if an editor has edited higher quality articles, which have been edited by better editors who have edited higher quality articles, then expertise is higher. That is, expertise is a function of quality calculated from 1\textsuperscript{st} iteration quality scores.
  \end{itemize}
 \item {\bf And so on, recursively \ldots}.\\
\end{itemize}

Although the interpretation is difficult to imagine past the very first iteration steps, the algorithm incorporates additional information on the quality of the articles and expertise of editor at each iteration. The higher order iterations of the method of reflections are written as,

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
 u_{e}^{(n+1)} = \frac{1}{k_{e}}\sum_{a=1}^{N_{a}} M \, u_{a}^{n}\\[7pt]
 u_{a}^{(n+1)} = \frac{1}{k_{a}}\sum_{e=1}^{N_{e}} M \, u_{e}^{n}.\\
\end{cases}
\label{HHhigher}
\end{equation}

The method of reflections however suffers from a problem which is rooted in the equal weight given to each score of the previous iteration. As a result, the method converges to a fixed point with all editors (and respectively all articles) having the same value, as a case of consensus dynamics \cite{caldarelli2012network}. It has therefore been proposed to consider giving variable weight to the scores from the previous iteration. It is also proposed to reconceptualize the {\it method of reflections} as a Markov process of random walkers on a bi-partite network, jumping with some probability from one node type to another node type \cite{caldarelli2012network}. A schematic representation of the random walk process on a bi-partite network is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:jumpers}. The intuition is the following: a random walker jumps with some probability from an editor to a given article (i.e. the editor's expertise is positively influenced by the article's quality), and with another probability from an article to a given editor (i.e. the value of the article is positively by the editor's expertise). The matrix $M$ determines the probability function between each pair of nodes. If two nodes $e$ and $a$ are not directly connected $M_{ea} = 0$, and the transition probability is 0. The {\it bi-partite network random walker} model is an extension of the {\it Page Rank} Google search algorithm \cite{page1999pagerank} to two kind of nodes 

\begin{figure}[!t]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{../Figures/bi-partite_net.eps}.
\caption{Representation of random walkers jumping from editors to articles (red dotted arrows) and from articles to editors (blue dotted arrows). The intuition is the following: a random walker jumps with some probability from an editor to a given article (i.e. the editor's expertise is positively influenced by the article's quality), and with another probability from an article to a given editor (i.e. the value of the article positively influences the editor's expertise).}
\label{fig:jumpers}
\end{figure}

According to  \cite{caldarelli2012network}, we reformulate the method of reflections to account for jumps of the random walker on the bi-partite network of editors and articles. We call $w^{(n)}_e$ the expertise of an editor and $w^{(n)}_a$ the quality of an article at the $n^{th}$ iteration. We define the following Markov process on the bi-partite network of collaboration, 

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
w^{(n+1)}_e (\alpha,\beta) = \sum_{a=1}^{N_a}  G_{ea}(\beta) \,w^{(n)}_a (\alpha,\beta)\\[7pt]
w^{(n+1)}_a (\alpha,\beta) = \sum_{e=1}^{N_e}  G_{ae}(\alpha) \, w^{(n)}_e (\alpha,\beta)\\
\end{cases}
\label{random_walker}
\end{equation}

with $G_{ea}$ the probability  to jump from article $a$ to editor $e$ in a single step, and the probability $G_{ae}$ to jump from editor $e$ to article $a$ also in a single step. These transition probabilities are given by,

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
G_{ea}(\beta) = \frac{M_{ea} k_{e}^{-\beta}}{\sum_{e' = 1}^{N_e} M_{e'a} k_{e'}^{-\beta}}\\[8pt]
G_{ae}(\alpha) = \frac{M_{ea} k_{a}^{-\alpha}}{\sum_{a' = 1}^{N_a} M_{ea'} k_{a'}^{-\alpha}}\\
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The transition matrices $G_{ea}(\beta)$ and $G_{ae}(\alpha)$ depend only on the initial conditions: the binary matrix $M$, as well as $k_e$ and $k_a$ given by (\ref{HHinit}). The variables $\alpha$ and $\beta$ control the transition probabilities in a similar way. We shall therefore explain only how $\beta$ influences the probability to jump from an article to an editor (i.e. the value of the article positively influences the editor's expertise). For $\beta = 0$, we recover the zero\textsuperscript{th} order iteration (\ref{HHinit}). For $\beta > 0$, the probability to jump from article $a$ to editor $e$ is a power law function $\sim 1/k_{e}^{\beta}$ of the sum of articles $k_{e}$  modified by editor $e$. Hence, the larger $k_{e}$, the lower the probability to jump from $a$ to $e$ relative to other editors. On the contrary, if $\beta < 0$ the probability to jump from an article to an editor is a positive function of the sum of articles modified by the editor. For $-1 < \beta < 0$, the function is concave, while for $\beta < -1$, the function is convex, which means that the more articles have been edited by the editor, the even more the positive influence on articles. In a nutshell, $\beta$ relates the amount of articles edited on the overall editor's expertise, which in turn has an influence on each edited article (along with the influence of other editors). If $\beta >> 0$, the positive influence of the number of contributed articles on the editor's expertise decreases. If $\beta$ close to $0$, the number of contributed articles increase linearly the editor's expertise. The same considerations hold for $\alpha$ and the probability $G_{ae}(\alpha)$ to jump from an editor to an article (i.e. the expertise of the editor positively influences the quality of an article).

After each iteration we have exepertise and quality scores. With those scores one can rank editors and articles. When the rankings for both editors and articles do not change in two successive iterations we consider the method of reflections converged. We have verified that the {\it bi-partite network random walker} method converges on all our 12 Wikipedia categories.  Figure \ref{fig:convergence} shows the evolution of expertise $w_e$ ranked among editors having contributed to articles in the {\it Feminist Writers} category on Wikipedia for arbitrary control parameters: $(\alpha,\beta) =(-0.5, 0.5)$. Starting from the sum of contributed articles as the initial step, we can see how the algorithm progressively ranks editors: some editors with initial low rank, i.e. with few articles edited, get a higher rank as the number of iterations increases. They must have edit few, but high quality articles. Similarly, some initially high ranked editors, gradually drop in the ranking. They must have edited many, but low quality articles. In the case of category {\it Feminist Writers}, the algorithm converges with clearly stable ranks, after nearly $50$ iterations.

In the case Wikipedia categories, the algorithm converges with clearly stable ranks, after nearly $\mathbf{50}$ iterations.}

The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ control how editors and articles influence each others at the level of the whole bi-partite collaboration network. Upon calibration they also inform on the structure of peer-production, and how contributions benefit to the whole open collaboration project. Whenever calibration shows that the evolution of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be predicted, then editors' expertise and articles' quality can also be predicted up to statistical errors. Here, we demonstrate the calibration steps for$\alpha$ and $\beta$ and how the control parameters inform on the structure of value creation in open collaboration. We also document the evolution of these parameters as Wikipedia categories get increasingly enriched with new contributions.

%A property of this algorithm, is that with the following balance condition,
%
%\begin{equation}
%\mathbf{G}_{ae} \mathbf{w}^*_e = \mathbf{G}_{ea} \mathbf{w}^*_a
%\end{equation}
%
%which can be rewritten as,
%
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{cases}
%\mathbf{w}^{*}_{e} \sim \mathbf{k}^{1-\beta}_{e} \langle \mathbf{k}_{a}^{-\alpha}\rangle_e \\
%\mathbf{w}^{*}_{a} \sim \mathbf{k}^{1-\alpha}_{a} \langle \mathbf{k}_{e}^{-\beta}\rangle_a
%\end{cases} \label{eqsim}
%\end{equation}

%it is the analytical formulation we use onwards. It is important to note a crucial difference in the way we apply the weighted random walk model in the case of open collaboration compared to the countries-products problem. In \cite{caldarelli2012network}, $w^*_p$ is a measure of ubiquity (i.e. dis-quality) because many countries can sell the product, while here $w^*_a$ is also a measure of ubiquity in the sense that many editors have modified the article. In the case of open collaboration, $w^*_a$ is a measure of quality.
