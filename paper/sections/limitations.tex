\section{Limitations}
\label{limitations}
We do not directly measure the {\it capabilities} of editors. For instance, what does one editor do best to improve an article, among the five metrics (ratio of mark-up to readable text, number of headings, article length, citations per article length, and outgoing intrawiki links) we have used to assess the quality of an article ? 

We have not looked at the evolution of the quality of correlation as a function of iteration steps.

``less is more" : Why is it that when we incorporate more information in the matrix M, the results are not better ? Here we took the most simple metric (unlike HH method).

Quality of the exogenous metrics, especially for editors. It would be definitely make to look at real capabilities.

We only look at the ranking not at the real quality/expertise values ? Can we learn more the real values about the gap between articles/editors ?

consider $\alpha$ and $\beta$ the same for $w_{a}$ and $w_{e}$
