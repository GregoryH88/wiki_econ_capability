\section{Related Work}
The structure and dynamics of individual and collective contributions have since long been recognized by researchers as primary factors for the achievement of high quality content, starting with scientific publications \cite{newman2001} and open collaboration projects \cite{bryant2005}. In the meantime, some of these open collaboration projects have tremendously increased their size and the number of their contributors, making it hard to assess the value of each knowledge artifact, even by intensive peer-review. Wikipedia, the iconic success story of open collaboration, has tried to find ways to determine it's own editor and article quality, which always faced criticism. Since 2005 many quality article metrics have been proposed from methods based on word count \cite{blumenstock2008sizematters}, the general structure of articles \cite{wang2013tell}, the revision history \cite{hu2007articlequality}, the patterns of changes between article versions \cite{woehner2009}, and combinations of type and volume of edits and editor expertise \cite{kane2011}. Editor expertise has also been investigated by considering the total number of words edited, the number of edits made, or the longevity of edits \cite{adler2008measuringauthor}, as well as time spent making edit sessions \cite{geiger2013}, or even the number of barnstars collected \cite{Kriplean2008}. More specific features of editors received the attention of researchers, such as creative editing \cite{iba2010}, how power editors differ from normal editors \cite{panciera2009}, and the influence of the type of contributors on the quality of articles \cite{stein2007}.

The effort to measure article quality and editor expertise has extended to predicting the quality of contributions \cite{druck2008learning,zeng2006computingtrust}, developing reputation systems for editors \cite{adler2007contentdriven}, and identifying editor candidates for promotion \cite{burke2008taking}.

\textcolor{red}{I think we can delete this paragraph, its off topic.}
In contrast, the difficulty to assess the quality of artifacts and the expertise of editors differs with the ease to make the same evaluation with software code which can be compiled and tested. In a Matlab experiment for solving NP-hard problems, it was found that work shared as a public good helps individuals quickly reuse existing results, and thus, find better algorithms \cite{gulley2010}. Source code submissions by individuals programmers were tested and benchmarked for their capacity to solve the assigned problem quickly, by executing the compiled code on a computer. Unfortunately, for the time being, this approach is exclusively feasible for machine executable knowledge (i.e. software code) and in highly controlled environments.

Another complication of open collaboration, and presumably its main value-added, is the coordination between contributors, and how it helps generate value through through peer-review \cite{hu2007articlequality,wilkinson2007}, implicit and explicit coordination \cite{kittur2008}, quantity and span of contributions regarding local and global networks\cite{arazy2010determinants}. Similarly, the position of articles within local and global networks of Wikipedia is significantly related to article quality \cite{kane2009}. It was also found that editors clustered by interest with higher coordinated efforts in densely populated clusters \cite{jesus2009}.  The effects of diversity on group productivity seem to increase group productivity \cite{chen2010}.

While collaboration and additional review by peers is generally perceived as positive, depending on the type of tasks and their required coordination, performance can be also be undermined by inadequate coordination \cite{kittur2009coordination}. \textcolor{red}{This last sentence has no point.} It has also been found that prior experience and article attributes influence the quality of collaboration \cite{keegan2012}. 

%Network characteristics and the value of collaborative user-generated content \cite{ransbotham2012network}  $\rightarrow$ considers only that information flows from one article to another through contributors. In this network approach, editors are ``mediators" of concepts.

%\textcolor{red}{count of articles by editors show also the ``span" of knowledge or skills. Our model doesn't account for editors who have topic specific skills, rather than wiki-formatting skills.}

The connection between article quality and editor expertise is present in nearly all literature aiming to understand of the value of Wikipedia. The typical structure of networks with edges that connect uniquely two kinds of nodes is called {\it bi-partite} \cite{newman2001}. The analysis of patterns in Wikipedia bi-partite networks confirmed the existence of overlapping cliques of densely connected articles and editors  \cite{jesus2009}. A more detailed analysis of medical and health-related articles on Wikipedia, showed that the position of articles in the bi-partite network of articles and editors significantly influenced its quality \cite{kane2009}. Bi-partite networks have also notably been used to study the patterns of self-organization of actors having collaborated in movies \cite{ramasco2004self}.

Recent developments in the science of {\it bi-partite} networks has shown the feasibility to rank entities of each type through a recursive algorithm called  {\it method of reflections}.This method has been tested on the bi-partite network of countries competing for exporting products \cite{hidalgo2007,hidalgo2009}. The model of reflections has been improved and complemented in more recent work, mainly to improve its robustness \cite{tacchella2012new, cristelli2012competitors, tacchella2013economic, cristelli2013measuring}. Caldarelli et al.\cite{caldarelli2012network} have proposed an alternative method, based on biased stochastic Markov chains, which helps further understand the mutual influence between nodes in bi-partite networks.

%Recent results show that the contribution dynamics of successful open source projects, stem from critical cascades of iterative improvements (commits), which in turn lead to super-linear {\it productive bursts} of contributions \cite{sornette2014howmuch}.  The conditions of emergence of productive bursts, include transparency, self-censored clans, emergent technology, problem front-loading, distributed screening, and modularity \cite{vonkrogh2014designing}.
